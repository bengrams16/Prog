<p>Dear Chittenden House Freshmen and Families:</p>
<p>With the school year approaching, we are getting excited to meet and welcome our new group of ninth graders to the Chittenden Core and the beginning of high school.  We teachers look forward to each of our students having a fun, exciting, and educational year, and are committed to providing high intellectual experiences and strong parent-teacher-student connections.  In that spirit, we’d like to take the opportunity to introduce ourselves and our philosophy, and to give you some important information about the start of the school year. </p>
<p>This will be the twenty-fifth year of the Core program, which was was initially established to provide a smaller community within the high school setting, one which values interdisciplinary connections between subject areas as well as the personalized learning that can come from strong relationships.  Our mission:</p>
<div id=mission>
<p>Chittenden Core believes that all students should look forward to their school day, feel connected to their teachers, be appropriately challenged, and be able to ask any question at anytime. Throughout the year, students will be asked to work and learn with different peer groups, become self-advocates and develop critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to build a respectful community within the larger CVU community where students feel safe to take healthy risks. We are excited to work with students and families who share this mission.</p>
</div>
<p> Because establishing relationships with parents and students early on is so important to us, we’d like to invite you to schedule a conference before school begins.  This is a great way to answer your questions, provide student schedules, and most importantly, get to meet each other.  Prior to these meetings there will also be a parent night at on Monday, August 22nd, which will provide a more general introduction to CVU. </p> 
<p> Thanks so much. Enjoy the rest of summer, and we’ll look forward to meeting with you at the end of August!  If you need to contact any of us, you can find our email addresses on the <a link rel=”www.cvuhs.org”CVU Website.> We’re online all the time, so feel free to email any time!
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Katie Mack, Molly Tonino, Sarah Crum, TJ Mead, Andrea Boehmcke  and Peter Booth

<h6> Peter Booth: Math </h6>
<p> I have been teaching since 1990.  I’ve been teaching math at CVU since 2001 and in that time I’ve taught every grade level and just about every math class our school offers.  Before coming to CVU in 2001, I taught English and math at Peoples Academy in Morrisville and before that at the Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center in Colchester. </p>
<h6> Molly Tonino: English </h6>
<p>I grew up in Charlotte, VT and graduated from CVU in 1999.  After four years studying English and Art History at college in Baltimore, MD, I returned to set up home base in my  favorite place
<span id=VT> (Vermont, of course!)</span>
to be a ski bum,  a waitress, and a traveller while I figured out what job I wanted to do in my life. </p>
<h6>Sarah Crum: Learning Specialist </h6>
<p>One of the most important things to know about me is that I love to explore new places and learn new things and I have been fortunate enough to be able to travel to many places in America and across the globe. When I can’t experience something by going there, I love to read stories about it. I am passionate about stories. I think everyone has a story to tell and I enjoy helping people find theirs.  
</p>
<h6>TJ Mead: Wellness </h6>
<p> I teach Project Adventure and Personal Health in the Chittenden Core. This will be my 11th year teaching in Chittenden Core and 12th year teaching at CVU. I am also a proud alumnus of CVU, so I’ve experienced this place from both perspectives. 
</p>
<h6> Andrea Boehmcke: Science</h6>
<p> I have been fortunate enough to be teaching Science for 24 years.  I grew up on Long Island, NY, where I spent most of my time swimming and lifeguarding at the ocean.  It is also where my career began teaching Biology and AP Biology. </p>
<h6>Katie Mack: Social Studies</h6>
<p>I have spent most of my adult life gradually moving North, having grown up in Baltimore City, attending college in New Jersey, and finally landing in Vermont in 2004 as an Americorps VISTA. After receiving my Masters of Education from UVM, I spent seven years teaching and coaching at BFA Fairfax.</p>
